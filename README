# README
This is our github repo for the OPERS Tracker React app, 
to set up the project you will need to download certain dependencies along with the React CLI. 

So, in order to circumvent all of that heres a code sandbox link to our project that will allow you to see and use our site: [https://nifj6.codesandbox.io/](https://nifj6.codesandbox.io/)
